# Gym Services Booking Application
### Mohammed Owais Ghafoor

### 1. Project Introduction

The purpose of this application is to allow for multiple customers to create bookings for different services and classes at the gym.<br>
This includes PT sessions, Swimming, Boxing and High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). It utilises CRUD functionality where the 'customer' has a one-to-many relationship with 'Booking'. 
This will allow the gym itself to access the database and Create, Read, Update or Delete customer and booking information when needed.<br>
